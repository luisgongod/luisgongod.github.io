Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Lui, and I'm an Engineer with a passion for tinkering and creating in the world of technology. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I have some engineering work here and there. I am not an expert but I got approximate knowledge of many things. In no particular order:

- Mechanical keyboards
- ESP32s n Arduinos
- 3D design n printing
- Batteries
- Synths
- LEDs
- Magnets (how do they work!?)

I believe in the power of collaboration and community. If you share similar interests, let me know! 



P.S. ChatGPT is my editor
